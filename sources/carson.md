# Rachel Carson: A Brief Biography

Rachel Louise Carson (1907-1964) was an American marine biologist, author, and conservationist whose book *Silent Spring* (1962) and other writings are credited with advancing the global environmental movement.

Born in Springdale, Pennsylvania, Carson developed a love for nature early in life. She graduated from Pennsylvania College for Women (now Chatham University) in 1929 and earned her M.A. in zoology from Johns Hopkins University in 1932.

Carson began her career as a marine biologist with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries (later the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service) in the 1930s. Her early works, *Under the Sea-Wind* (1941) and *The Sea Around Us* (1951), established her as a gifted writer and keen observer of marine life. *The Sea Around Us* became a national bestseller, won the National Book Award, and provided her with financial independence, allowing her to pursue writing full-time.
